The folder client-files contains files that may be useful when making maps for this mod. The files may be put into the directory of a ddnet client, so they can be used.

./editor/entities/twPointer.png can be set to be the entities image used in the map editor. It is more clear what the tiles mean for this mod, than the ddnet entities image.

./assets/entities/twPointer.png can be set to be the entities image used in-game. While playing with entities on, it is more clear what the tiles mean in this mod. However, it will replace the ddnet image. Thus, if you want to play ddraces you will have to reset the entities image used to another like the default.

./mapres/extra_tiles.png can be used as mapres in maps. This can be used to indicate the modded tiles in maps.
